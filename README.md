# OUR_Fall24

## Introduction

In this semester's OUR project, we will be testing the hypothesis that **co-expressed genes have similar codon usage bias**.

To do this we will use standard machine learning analyses, primarily focused on random forest classification. Throughout the semester we will work our way through the analysis below. 

## Background

### Codon Usage Bias

Codon usage bias is the unequal use of synonymous codons within or between genes and genomes. We now know that some codons are decoded into amino acids faster and more efficiently than other codons. We refer to these as **optimal** codons. We hypothesize that the codon content of genes is a key feature for co-regulation.

### KEGG modules

KEGG is a database that helps us understand the possible functions of genes we identify in genomes. One component is KEGG Ontologies or KEGG IDs. These are assigned to genes based on sequence similarity to a reference
